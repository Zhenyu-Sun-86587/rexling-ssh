# Rexlink Android

Native Kotlin/Compose UI, Canvas terminal rendering and Android input/lifecycle
integration for the unofficial Rexlink client. Open this directory in Android
Studio. The Rust workspace is next door in `../rexlink-core/`; Gradle builds it
automatically. No separate old rex-probe or rex-android checkout is needed.

See [root README](../README.md) and [BUILDING.md](../BUILDING.md) for complete
toolchain requirements, reproducible commands and licensing.

From this directory:

```sh
./scripts/gradle.sh :app:assembleRelease
./scripts/gradle.sh :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintRelease
python3 scripts/test_jni.py
python3 scripts/verify_apk.py --apk app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk --require-release
```

The release APK is `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` (arm64, API 28+).
Run `./scripts/gradle.sh :app:shareRelease` for a copy in `dist/` named
`Rexlink-<date>-build<code>-<commit>-arm64-release.apk`, with a SHA-256 checksum.
Its identity matches **⋮ → About Rexlink**; local edits add `-modified`.
The package remains `dev.shulhi.rex`, preserving existing installs and settings.
Local releases retain the development signing identity; configure production
signing separately before publishing. SDK paths and caches remain ignored.

## Usage

- Keep Tailscale connected and use an explicit authenticated Rex server URL.
  **⋮ → Servers** saves hosts and keeps several connected at once.
- The compact header shows the task/program title, a working-directory line
  when available, then session · server. Tap the session to search, swipe to
  cycle across hosts, wrapping in either direction, or long-press to return to the last session. In the session
  list, open a row’s **⋮ → Rename session** to change its name on the server.
- Swipe the content card to switch panes, looping from last to first or first to last. The bottom tabs remember their pane;
  pane options switch, create or close panes/tabs. Destructive close actions
  require confirmation and end the programs in that resource.
- A newly selected ready pane is automatically claimed once and resized to the
  phone. Switching away/backgrounding releases it. Manual Take/Release live in
  **⋮**. Another owner's dimensions appear in a contextual takeover notice.
- The Activity eye opens reports grouped by server. Unseen attention reports
  produce a dot; **Mark seen** acknowledges a report locally. Activity does not
  take ownership merely to scan reports.
- The terminal streams snapshot plus incremental VT, with real Ghostty
  scrollback, copy selection, OSC 8/printed links, Nerd Fonts and mouse-aware
  full-screen scrolling. Shared PTY dimensions affect other attached clients.
- Typing uses Rex’s ordered key-event stream with up to eight requests in flight.
  Delayed acknowledgments no longer stop terminal output or rendering. Adjacent
  queued plain text can be combined without delaying the first keystroke.
- The one-row keyboard dock offers modifiers, a hold-and-slide arrow joystick, a dedicated Enter key,
  hold/repeat, Ctrl shortcuts and an expandable panel with F1–F12.
- **⋮ → Preferences → Appearance** saves independent light/dark presets, including the
  Rexlink defaults. Font size changes in 1-sp steps. Theme requests are sent
  while owning the pane; programs may override their own colorscheme.
- Reconnect notices expose input-paused state and Retry now. Network changes
  trigger retry; uncertain input is never automatically resent.

Protocol findings and historical check results remain in [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md),
[TESTING.md](TESTING.md), and [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md). Older entries use
the paths from before consolidation; current commands are in the root build guide.

Project code: [Apache 2.0](../LICENSE). Bundled third-party notices are retained in
`app/src/main/assets/licenses/` and listed in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

Multi-pane program icons fan out sideways with a subtle counterclockwise front
tile and opposing back tilts. The active program stays in front; single-pane
icons remain upright. Both header and tab icons use the same treatment. The
header reserves the same width for one, two or three tiles and centers the
visible stack, keeping the title and directory aligned when pane counts change.

## Image uploads

Configure each Rex server under **⋮ → Preferences → Portside**. Rexlink calls
[Portside](https://github.com/shulhi/portside) 0.3+'s Tailscale-authenticated upload
API directly; see its repository for server installation and hosting setup.
Keyboard image paste,
menu Paste and Attach image upload PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP files and insert the returned
server path without submitting the prompt. Uploaded images remain ready for the
original pane if you navigate away. The separate Portside app can be opened from
settings but is not required for transfers. See the root README for setup and
BUILDING.md for the optional real-server fixture test.
